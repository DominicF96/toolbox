# Toolbox

This is my personal toolbox. It contains a collection of scripts and tools that I use on a daily basis.

## Code Generation / Templating

- **[EZReactComponents](https://github.com/DominicF96/ez-react-components) - My own tool to generate a large quantity of React components in a few seconds**
   - The components are generated from templates and are built with Typescript, SASS, Storybook and Jest.
- **[SVGtoJSX](https://github.com/DominicF96/svg-to-jsx) - My own tool to convert SVGs to React components**
- [svgr](https://react-svgr.com/) - Convert SVGs to React components
